My name is Qixing Li. I am a part-time graduate student at the City University of New York(CUNY), my major is Data Science. Before that, I obtained a MBA from St John's University in Business Analytics. I have strong interests in various tech stuff such as Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptocurrencies, and etc. I am always interested in learning more about state-of-the-art learning methods, and applying them to solve real world problems.

Right now I am seeking a position where I can excel my skills and contribute my value as much as I can.
